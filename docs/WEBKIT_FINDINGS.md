# WebKit Findings — PS5 14.10

Independent browser-side research on PS5 firmware 14.10. Findings are from probes run on the actual console via the PS5's built-in browser (User's Guide DNS redirect). No raw beacon logs are included; the results below are from the probe results table maintained in the source repository.

## Finding 1: Unpatched MetadataTable Integer Overflow (JSC Bug 317632)

`UnlinkedMetadataTable::finalize()` in JavaScriptCore uses an `unsigned` accumulator to sum metadata entry sizes. With 38,348,816 `op_call` sites at 112 bytes each:

```
38,348,816 × 112 = 4,295,067,392
uint32 wraps to 100,096
```

The allocator reserves ~100 KiB. The interpreter writes 4.29 GiB forward into heap memory.

**On-device results:**

| Probe | Test | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| p141 | Overflow with stride=96 (wrong) | SIGSEGV — confirms OOB write occurs |
| p142 | Overflow with stride=112 (correct) | Overflow triggers |
| p143 | Targets placed before buffer | No corruption — sweep is forward only |
| p144 | Bait-and-switch heap groom | Forward write confirmed |
| p146 | Worker polls `.length` on target strings | All 14 report `.length` = 81400 — **RETRACTED as false positive**: 814-char literal × 100 = 81,400 (real length, no corruption) |

Scripts: `p142-heap-survive.js`, `p146-string-primary.js`

## Finding 2: Controlled Heap Corruption via Bait-and-Switch

The heap groom pattern from p146:

1. Main thread allocates 20 "bait" strings (~100 KiB each, Primary heap)
2. Worker allocates 14 "target" strings (~100 KiB each, same heap, higher addresses)
3. Free baits + GC pressure — metadata buffer takes a freed bait slot (first-fit)
4. Overflow sweep writes forward into target strings
5. Worker detects corruption via `.length` change and `charCodeAt()` scan

**On-device result (p146) — RETRACTED (2026-10-20):** the `.length = 81400` reports were the real string length, not corruption: the p146/p156 worker chunk literal is 814 characters, so the strings are 814 × 100 = 81,400 chars from birth and the `len !== 100000` check fires trivially. Definitive test: [V480 with loop-built 1000-char chunks reports 0 of 14 corrupted](https://github.com/pastawithpesto/PS5-14.10-Jailbreak-Research/blob/master/analysis/false-positive-81400.md). The MetadataTable overflow itself stands (compile OK, call crash ~88s in); no string corruption is demonstrated.

## Finding 3: StringImpl Backing Data Stays Intact

**Probes:** p147, p148, p156

The overflow corrupts the JSString header (`m_fiber`), not the StringImpl character data.

| Probe | Test | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| p147, p148 | Substring and main-thread views | StringImpl data intact, JSString.m_fiber corrupted |
| p156 | `charCodeAt` scan over intact-header strings | All return 0x41 within `[0, 100000)`; header-corrupt strings were only read 32 bytes deep |

**Impact (revised 2026-10-20):** there was no header corruption and no length-window change to analyze — the strings were 81,400 chars with 81,400 capacity. The earlier impact text and the length-window audit both analyzed the false positive.

The length value must exceed the real capacity before this becomes a read primitive; see [WEBKIT_LENGTH_WINDOW_AUDIT.md](WEBKIT_LENGTH_WINDOW_AUDIT.md) and probe `p161-length-window.js`.

Script: `p156-bait-switch.js`

## Finding 4: All Relapse WebKit Bugs Patched on 14.10

**Probe:** p160

Tested three independent Relapse WebKit exploit primitives:

| Bug | Technique | Result |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Scope object leak | `super.foo` + Proxy receiver | `receiver === undefined` — **patched** |
| Symbol.toString disclosure | Large string with heap pointers | Length mismatch — **patched** |
| structuredClone type confusion | `history.replaceState` graph | No type confusion — **patched** |

Combined with the Lua-side results in this repo (AF_ROUTE KASLR probe 43o, AIO bypass probe 43p), the Relapse chain is dead on 14.10 across both entry vectors.

Script: `p160-relapse-test.js`

## Entry Method

The PS5 browser is reachable without hardware modification:

1. Run a DNS/HTTPS server on the local network
2. Point PS5 DNS settings to the server
3. Open Settings → User's Guide on the PS5
4. PS5 browser loads the exploit page from the redirected domain

No jailbroken PS4, no save file chain, no game purchase required. Probes communicate via HTTP beacon callbacks (XHR GET/POST) to the host server.

## Current Status

Snapshot status below; the [source repository](https://github.com/pastawithpesto/PS5-14.10-Jailbreak-Research) is authoritative for current progress.

| Stage | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Bug identification | Done |
| Trigger on device | Done |
| Heap grooming | Done |
| JSString corruption | Done |
| Data extraction (ASLR leak) | Not started — the 81400 "corruption" was a false positive (see Finding 2); no corruption primitive is demonstrated |
| Arbitrary read/write | Not started |

## Updates Since This Snapshot (2026-10-19)

- **p156 "reproduction" on a second console — same false positive (corrected 2026-10-20):** the 14/14 `.length` = 81400 reports were the literal string length (814-char chunk × 100), not corruption. The OOM-death-vs-beacon-ordering data from that console's 17 runs remains valid ([issue #6](https://github.com/pastawithpesto/PS5-14.10-Jailbreak-Research/issues/6)).
- **p160 (Relapse primitives) also confirmed dead on the second console** — independent reproduction of our PR #32 result (54/54, scope receiver `undefined`).
- **New best lead: CVE-2026-43715 (CSSFontFace UAF)** — source-verified against WK-1400 (`iterateClients()` re-entrant client removal via a `FontFace.prototype.then` getter), patched upstream, unpatched on PS5 14.10. Device test deployed, awaiting crash confirmation. Not blocked by the JS builtin wall that limits the stream-based bugs.
- **Kernel audit published** (their [KERNEL_AUDIT.md](https://github.com/pastawithpesto/PS5-14.10-Jailbreak-Research/blob/master/docs/KERNEL_AUDIT.md)): Tier-1 candidates CVE-2026-7270 (assessed in this repo), CVE-2026-45251 (poll/select UAF, not yet assessed here), and CVE-2024-43102 (umtx — patch status reopened by our PR #41: `_umtx_op` is 454 and alive; earlier "umtx" tests hit 557).
- **Length-window audit** ([WEBKIT_LENGTH_WINDOW_AUDIT.md](WEBKIT_LENGTH_WINDOW_AUDIT.md)) — analyzed the false positive; its capacity question dissolves. The p161 probe it inspired remains correct (PR #43 fixed its blob construction) and now tests whether the correct-strings groom corrupts at all.
